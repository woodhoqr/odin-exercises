			<h2>What is the best workout split?</h2>
		</div>

		<p>Instead of creating a "bro" split and having workout days based on specific body parts,
			try creating a program where your days are based on 
			<em><strong>human movements and motions</strong></em>. This method allows you to ensure
			each muscle group is worked at least twice a week, and makes for a more efficient session.
