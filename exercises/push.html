		<h3>Muscles Worked in Pushing Motions</h3>

		<p>Pushing motions work what would be considered muscles on the 
			<em>anterior</em> of the body, with secondary muscles on the 
			<em>posterior</em> worked as well.
		</p>

		<h4>What muscles are worked in a push up</h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Pectorals</li>
			<li>Deltoids</li>
			<li>Triceps</li>
			<li>Core</li>
		</ul>

		<p>When planning out a "push day", I have found it best to order 
			pushing movements based on orientation, supersetted each with
			a core exercise. This gives about 4 push exercises and 2-4 core exercises.
			You can add 2 accessory exercises for the smaller muscle worked, as well!
			This is completely optional, however
		</p>
