		<h3>Muscles Worked in Pulling Motions</h3>

		<p>Pulling motions work what would be considered muscles on the 
			<em>posterior</em> of the body, with secondary muscles on the 
			<em>anterior</em> worked as well.
		</p>

		<h4>What muscles are worked in a pull up</h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Lats</li>
			<li>Posterior Deltoids</li>
			<li>Traps (middle and lower)</li>
			<li>Biceps</li>
			<li>Infraspinatus (External Shoulder Rotator)</li>
			<li>Forearm muscles</li>
			<li>Core</li>
		</ul>

		<p>When planning out a "pull day", I have found it best to order 
			pushing movements based on orientation, supersetted each with
			a core exercise. This gives about 4 pull exercises and 2-4 core exercises.
			You can add 2 accessory exercises for the smaller muscle worked, as well!
			This is completely optional.
		</p>
