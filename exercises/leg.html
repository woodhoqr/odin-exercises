		<h3>Muscles Worked in a Compound Leg Movement</h3>

		<p>
			Leg day is used to work your <em><strong>entire</strong></em> leg.
			Front and back, top and bottom. We don't want to be able to <em>walk</em> 
			straight after an amazing leg day!!!
		</p>

		<h4>What muscles are worked in a squat</h4>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Quads</li>
			<li>Glutes</li>
			<li>Calves</li>
			<li>Hamstrings</li>
			<li>Core</li>
		</ul>

		<p>When planning out a "leg day", I have found it best to order 
			pushing movements based on whether it's the front or the back
			(quad or hamstring dominanat) of the leg, supersetted each 
			with a core exercise. This gives about 4 leg exercises and 
			2-4 core exercises. You can add 2 accessory exercises for the 
			smaller muscles worked, as well! This is optional!
		</p>
