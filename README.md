# odin-exercises
Odin Recipes project, reworked it into a list of exercises

In this project, I have created what is essentially a roadmap of creating 
a Push/Pull/Leg workout routine.  This was an adaptation of The Odin 
Project's HTML Foundations Recipe project.

In creating this website, I demonstrated skills relating to:

Adding images, creating un/ordered lists, using headings, adding new pages 
and linking them together via the index. 

In uploading to GitHub, I demonstrated skills in staging, committing, and 
pushing remotely to GitHub via my system's terminal shell
